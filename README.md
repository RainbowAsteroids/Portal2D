Portal, but minus a dimension and story

This is a simple game I've been making on and off for some time now in Godot. If you want the latest version, check it out [by clicking Releases above](https://gitlab.com/RainbowAsteroids/Portal2D/-/releases) and downloading the first ZIP file.

Any bug reports or suggestions are welcome on the issues tab and any feedback is welcome at my email at feedback@portal2d.xyz
